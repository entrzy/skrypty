To import a .cer certificate into Tomcat 9 server on a Linux system, you need to convert the certificate into a format that Tomcat can use, which means converting it into a Java keystore file (JKS or PKCS12). Here are the steps you should follow:

1. Install the keytool utility
Ensure you have the keytool utility installed, which is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK). You can check this by typing in the terminal:


keytool -help

2. Convert the .cer file to a keystore
First, if you only have the public certificate (.cer file), you must also have the private key with which this certificate was issued. Assuming you have both the private key and the certificate, you can create a PKCS12 keystore file, which is now preferred by Tomcat:

bash
Copy code
openssl pkcs12 -export -in mycert.cer -inkey mykey.key -out keystore.p12 -name alias_name
In the command above:

mycert.cer is your certificate.
mykey.key is your private key.
keystore.p12 is the name of the keystore file to be created.
alias_name is the alias under which the private key and certificate will be stored in the keystore.
3. Configure Tomcat to use the new keystore
Edit the Tomcat configuration file server.xml, found in the conf directory of the Tomcat installation directory. Find the connector definition for HTTPS, which looks something like this:

xml
Copy code
<Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
           connectionTimeout="20000"
           redirectPort="8443"
           scheme="https"
           secure="true"
           SSLEnabled="true"
           keystoreFile="/path/to/keystore.p12"
           keystorePass="password"
           keystoreType="PKCS12" />
In the example above:

keystoreFile indicates the path to the keystore file.
keystorePass is the password for the keystore, which you set during the export to PKCS12.
keystoreType is set to PKCS12.
4. Restart Tomcat
After making changes to the configuration, restart the Tomcat server for the changes to take effect:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl restart tomcat9
or

bash
Copy code
/path/to/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh
/path/to/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
