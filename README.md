The implementation of the new PS QUESTIO version will be a structured, phased process, ensuring minimal operational disruption. It includes an initial system assessment, stakeholder engagement, detailed planning, comprehensive training, rigorous testing, and a gradual rollout. Post-implementation, we will conduct a review to assess the upgrade's success and gather feedback for future improvements. This approach aims to ensure a smooth transition with maximum efficiency and minimal impact on daily activities.
