Based on the provided information, here is the revised and detailed list of tasks related to points 1-5, translated into English:

1. Checking User Permissions:
   - Ensure that you have root permissions or the appropriate sudo rights on all servers.
   - Additionally, verify that the technical user has access to the database and possesses the necessary permissions to manage and manipulate data.

2. Verifying System Requirements:
   - Check if the servers meet the hardware and software requirements for each component of the application (WEB, APP, DB).
   - Ensure that you have sufficient resources (CPU, RAM, disk space) on each server.

3. Updating System and Software:
   - Update the operating system and all packages on the servers to the latest versions.

4. Network Configuration and Traffic Monitoring:
   - Check if port 8888 is unblocked between the WEB and APP servers to enable communication between these components.
   - Ensure that the database port is unblocked between the WEB and DB servers, as well as between APP and DB, which is crucial for communication with the database.
   - Verify that traffic from end-user computers to the WEB server on ports 8080 and 8090 is unblocked. If a load balancer is present, ensure that traffic on these ports is also correctly routed through the load balancer.

5. Checking Database Availability and Configuration:
   - Ensure that the database server is accessible and functioning properly.
   - Check if the DB configuration aligns with the application's requirements, including version, parameters, and access permissions.

Executing these steps will help ensure that all components of the application can interact properly, and the installation will proceed smoothly.
