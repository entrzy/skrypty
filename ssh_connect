Here's a basic PowerShell script example:

powershell
Copy code
# PowerShell Script to Automate SSH Login

# Define SSH parameters
$sshHost = "your_ssh_host" # Replace with your SSH host
$sshUser = "your_username" # Replace with your SSH username
$sshPass = "your_password" # Replace with your SSH password
$sshPort = 22 # Replace with your SSH port if different from the default

# Convert password to SecureString
$securePass = ConvertTo-SecureString $sshPass -AsPlainText -Force

# Create a PSCredential object
$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($sshUser, $securePass)

# Start the SSH process
$sshProcess = Start-Process ssh -ArgumentList "$sshUser@$sshHost -p $sshPort" -Credential $credential -WindowStyle Hidden -PassThru

# Wait for the process to exit
$sshProcess.WaitForExit()
To run this script:

Open PowerShell.
Navigate to the directory where your script is saved.
Run the script by typing .\scriptname.ps1, replacing scriptname.ps1 with the name of your script file.
Important Security Notes:

Storing passwords in plain text, as in this script, is not secure. Anyone with access to this script can see the password.
Consider using SSH keys for a more secure, password-less login.
Ensure that you understand the security implications of automating logins in this manner, especially in a production environment.
This script is a basic example and might need modifications based on your specific requirements and environment.
